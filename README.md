# BCG-Strategy-Consulting-2025

I recently participated in BCG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Strategy Consulting team at BCG.

I worked on a project to help a telecom company investigate solutions for falling profits. I conducted market research, practiced using excel to build predictive models, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.
